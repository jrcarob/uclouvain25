# Materials for the lecture on Portfolio Optimization 

## UCLouvain March 2025 - Staff Week

This lecture provides a foundational understanding of portfolio optimization with R. By combining theoretical concepts with practical implementation, students will gain valuable insights into portfolio construction and risk management.

Interactive learning methods, practical exercises and real-world examples will be incorporated throughout the course. The focus will be on practical applications of quantitative finance using R , and students will develop skills in financial data manipulation, scenario simulation and the application of advanced models. This course ensures a high level understanding of R programming and its application in quantitative finance, starting with the basics and moving towards more complex topics. The features and plan of the course require participants to have some background in statistics and econometrics at the basic level seen in the Bachelor of Business Administration courses.

Learning Objectives:
* Understand the core concepts of portfolio theory.
* Learn basic R programming for financial applications.
* Implement portfolio optimization algorithms in R.
* Evaluate and analyze portfolio performance.

Materials provided:
 - Slides
 - Excel file for portfolio optimization and efficient frontier
 - R codes for simulate efficient portfolios with financial libraries `quantmod`, `PortfolioAnalytics` and lecture exercise solution
